Let’s start a new life from the darkness
Until the light reveals the end
Sinister faces, growing curses
 
This is my last war
 
(Angels playing disguised with devil’s faces
Children cling to their coins squeezing out their wisdom)
 
(Angels playing disguised with devil’s faces
Children cling on their very last coins)
 
Destruction and regeneration
You are the real enemy
 
War
(My) War
(My) War...
